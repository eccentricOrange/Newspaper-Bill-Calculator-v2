# Apologies for a blank ReadMe.

This app is no longer maintained. I had created it with a purpose, and that it has fulfilled beautifully. Now, I realise that LabVIEW is not the best tool to make something like this, and I'm remaking (and expanding the scope of) it with better tools. The hope it to basically learn some web developement, but that will take time.

I'll be doing this in stages, and will update each subsequent stage with info. You may find the current version of the application here: https://github.com/eccentricOrange/npbc
